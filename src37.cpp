/*
	****************** Modes of Inheritance *****************


    ***** Public mode: If we derive a sub class from a public base class.
    					Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived class 
    					and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.

    ***** Protected mode: If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class.
    					Then both public member and protected members of the base class 
    					will become protected in derived class.

    ***** Private mode: If we derive a sub class from a Private base class.
    					Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become Private in derived class.



Note : The private members in the base class cannot be directly accessed in the derived class,
while protected members can be directly accessed. 
For example, Classes B, C and D all contain the variables x, y and z in below example. It is just question of access.
