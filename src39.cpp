/*

Multiple Inheritance: Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.
i.e one sub class is inherited from more than one base classes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class1, access_mode base_class2, ....
{
  //body of subclass
};


Here, the number of base classes will be separated by a comma 
(‘, ‘) and access mode for every base class must be specified.
